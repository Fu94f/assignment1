        <h4>Lyrics</h4>
        <p> [Verse 1]
            <br>
            I can't go far without hitting the sea
            <br>
            I won't last long without a shop that I need Red Bull from to get me through the day
            <br>
            And I feel bad 'cause I didn't cry when someone I grew up with died
            <br>
            But I break down every time I'm on the scales
            <br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus]
            <br>
            Always the cowboy, never the cow
            <br>
            I hate the way my life turned out
            <br>
            There ain't no ranch to roam inside my room
            <br>
            And I've got cotton wool for arms
            <br>
            I won't be much use on the farm
            <br>
            So I'll stay inside and watch him sing his tune
            <br>
            Four, three, two
            <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            Spin round on the playground
            <br>
            Oh I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby, alone
            <br>
            I don't need you to walk me homе
            <br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]
            <br>
            My style icon is the Wolverinе
            <br>
            Between each finger lies the key
            <br>
            To getting home without a buckaroo
            <br>
            And I see rodents at the foot of my bed
            <br>
            In the morning light when the sun is red
            <br>
            And I don't know what that means but it's coming true
            <br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus]
            <br>
            Always the cowboy, never the cow
            <br>
            I hate the way my life turned out
            <br>
            It goes faster every time that I go to sleep
            <br>
            And talk about adventurin'
            <br>
            I hope to God that this ain't it
            <br>
            And I just can't feel it 'cause I've got nothing left
            <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            Spin round on the playground
            <br>
            Oh I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby, alone
            <br>
            I don't need you to walk me homе
            <br>
            <br>
            [Bridge]  
            <br>
            You asked me what I want to be
            <br>
            I answer you so truthfully
            <br>
            I wanna go to my first rodeo
            <br>
            What's that cracked up to be?
            <br>
            I wanna stop relying on men who are bigger than me
            <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            Spin round on the playground
            <br>
            Oh I wanna be a cowboy, baby
            <br>
            I wanna be a cowboy, baby, alone
            <br>
            I don't need you to walk me homе
        </p>
